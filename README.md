# This is challenge #1.

## Learn about HTML tags

The goal with this HTML challenges is to try to use different HTML tags and try to build this small website for Converse All Star shoe.

## Files overview 
This repository includes following files:

* index.html - This file is the first HTML file you create as youâ€™re building a website. HTML ( HyperText Markup Language) can be seen as block elements that helps to structure your website. The index.html page is the default page a website visitor sees if no other page is specified.

* css - (Cascading Style Sheet) is an folder in the root directory which typically contains the style.css file.

* style.css - This file contains all styling and is used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS describes how HTML elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

* img - ( an abbreviation for image) is an folder in the root directory which typically contains all images that will be applied on a website.

## The HTML `<DOCTYPE>` declaration

### Examples

`<!DOCTYPE html>`<br>
All **HTML** documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration.<br>
The declaration is not an **HTML** tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.<br><br>

## The `<html>` Element

### Examples

`<html lang="en">`<br>
`</html>`<br>
The `<html>` tag comes in pairs and represents the root of an HTML document and is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the `<!DOCTYPE>` tag). Always include the _lang_ attribute inside the `<html>`tag to assiste search engines and browsers.<br><br>

## The `<head>` Element

`<head>`<br>
`</head>`<br>
The `<head>` tag comes in pairs and primarily contains header information about the document, such as its title, keywords, description, and style sheet** <br>

### Examples

`<meta charset="UFT-8">`<br>
Define the character set used and comes as single tag<br><br>

`<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, Tags, structure, block-elements, inline-elements">`<br>
Define keywords for search engines and comes as single tag<br><br>

`<meta name="author" content="John Doe">`<br>
Define the author of a page and comes as single tag<br><br>

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`<br>
Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices and comes as single tag<br><br>

`<title>HTML5 Tags and structure</title>`<br>
The`<title>` tag comes in pairs and defines a title in the browser toolbar and provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites in the browser** <br><br>

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">`<br>
The `<link>` tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource and is often used to link to external style sheets. It comes as single tag.<br><br>

**Another example with `<link>` tag is when you want to create a favicon to your website**<br>

`<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="img/favicon.ico">`<br>
A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab and comes as single tag.<br><br>

## The `<body>` Element

`<body>`<br>
`</body>`<br>

The `<body>` tag comes in pairs and defines the main content of the HTML document that will be directly visible on your web page. The `<body>` tag contains such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.** <br>

## HTML Block and Inline Elements

The HTML elements can be categorized into two broader categories, inline and block elements.<br>
The block elements break the flow of content and start a new line - here are som examples of block element<br>
Two commonly used block elements are: `<h1>` and `<p>`.<br><br>

### Example

`<h1>`Hello World`</h1>`<br>
`<p>`This is a paragraph.`<p>`<br>

**Here are the block-elements in HTML:**<br>
`<address>` `<article>` `<aside>` `<blockquote>` `<canvas>` `<dd>` `<div>` `<dl>` `<dt>` `<fieldset>` `<figcaption>` `<figure>` `<footer>` `<form>` `<h1>`-`<h6>` `<header>` `<hr>` `<li>` `<main>`
`<nav>` `<ol>` `<pre>` `<section>` `<table>` `<tfoot>` `<ul>` `<video>`<br><br>

An inline element does not start on a new line - it only takes up as much width as necessary.<br>
**The `<span>` element is a inline tag**<br>

### Example

`<span>`Hello World`</span>`<br>

**Here are other inline-elements in HTML:**<br>

`<a>` `<abbr>` `<acronym>` `<b>` `<bdo>` `<big>` `<br>` `<button>` `<cite>` `<code>` `<em>` `<i>` `<img>` `<input>` `<label>` `<map>`
`<object>` `<output>` `<q>` `<samp>` `<script>` `<select>` `<small>` `<span>` `<strong>` `<sub>` `<sup>` `<textarea>` `<time>` <br>

## Headings 1-6

`<h1>`<br>
`<h2>`<br>
`<h3>`<br>
`<h4>`<br>
`<h5>`<br>
`<h6>`<br><br>

The `<h1>` tag defines the largest heading in HTML and `<h6>` defines the smallest heading.
